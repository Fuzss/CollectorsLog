# Collector's Log

The mod adds a button adjacent to the crafting menu button in your survival inventory that can be opened into a seperate gui. This gui shows every item you've obtained in your playthrough including modded items specifically through the item pickup mechanic including crafted items. This menu serves as a competionist's guide to all items and blocks collected.
